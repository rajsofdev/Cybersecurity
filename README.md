**Module 01: Introduction to Ethical Hacking**

Fundamental Security Concepts
The whole principle is to avoid Theft, Tampering and Disruption of the systems through CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability).

•	Confidentiality Keeping systems and data from being accessed, seen, read to anyone who is not authorized to do so. Information is accessible only to the autorized personnel.

•	Integrity TRUSTWORTHINESS OF DATA OR RESOUCES: Protect the data from modification or deletion by unauthorized parties, and ensuring that when authorized people make changes that shouldn't have been made the damage can be undone.

•	Availability ACCESSIBLE WHEN REQUIRED BY AUTHORIZED USERS: Systems, access channels, and authentication mechanisms must all be working properly for the information they provide and protect to be available when needed.

•	Authenticity Refers to the characterstic of a communication, document, or any data that ensures the quality of being geniune.

Note: In addition, other properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved. (ISO/IEC 27000:2009)

•	Auditing & Accountability Basically keep tracking of everthing, like, who's been logging in when are they loggin in whose access this data.

•	Non-Repudiation Non-repudiation is the assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of something. Non-repudiation is a legal concept that is widely used in information security and refers to a service, which provides proof of the origin of data and the integrity of the data.

**Security, Functionality and Usability balance**

There is an inter dependency between these three attributes. When security goes up, usability and functionality come down. Any organization should balance between these three qualities to arrive at a balanced information system.

•	Black Hat - Hackers that seek to perform malicious activities.

•	Gray Hat - Hackers that perform good or bad activities but do not have the permission of the organization they are hacking against.

•	White Hat - Ethical hackers; They use their skills to improve security by exposing vulnerabilities before malicious hackers.

Script Kiddie / Skiddies - Unskilled individual who uses malicious scripts or programs, such as a web shell, developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites.

State-Sponsored Hacker - Hacker that is hired by a government or entity related.

Hacktivist - Someone who hacks for a cause; political agenda.

Suicide Hackers - Are hackers that are not afraid of going jail or facing any sort of punishment; hack to get the job done.

Cyberterrorist - Motivated by religious or political beliefs to create fear or disruption.


**Hacking Vocabulary**

•	Hack value - Perceived value or worth of a target as seen by the attacker.

•	Vulnerability - A system flaw, weakness on the system (on design, implementation etc).

•	Threat - Exploits a vulnerability.

•	Exploit - Exploits are a way of gaining access to a system through a security flaw and taking advantage of the flaw for their benefit.

•	Payload - Component of an attack; is the part of the private user text which could also contain malware such as worms or viruses which performs the malicious action; deleting data, sending spam or encrypting data.

•	Zero-day attack - Attack that occurs before a vendor knows or is able to patch a flaw.

•	Daisy Chaining / Pivotting - It involves gaining access to a network and /or computer and then using the same information to gain access to multiple networks and computers that contains desirable information.

•	Doxxing - Publishing PII about an individual usually with a malicious intent.

•	Enterprise Information Security Architecture (EISA) - determines the structure and behavior of organization's information systems through processes, requirements, principles and models.
